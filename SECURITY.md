# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest release of trident receives security updates. If you are running an older version, please upgrade before reporting.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/tbckr/trident/security/advisories/new). This keeps your report confidential until a fix is available.

Please include:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- The version of trident you are using
- Your OS and architecture
- Any relevant logs or output (with sensitive data redacted)

## Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgement**: within 7 days of your report
- **Fix target**: within 30 days for confirmed vulnerabilities

Timelines may vary depending on severity and complexity.

## Scope

This policy covers the trident CLI tool itself. It does not cover the third-party APIs and services that trident queries (e.g. crt.sh, ThreatMiner, Quad9). Issues with those services should be reported to their respective maintainers.

## Responsible Disclosure

Please do not publicly disclose a vulnerability until a fix has been released. We will coordinate with you on disclosure timing and credit you in the release notes unless you prefer to remain anonymous.
